# Littlefoot
A lightweight [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) alternative in Vanilla Javascript.

## History

I know barely nothing about Javascript nor have the resources to test this on a larger scale. I decided to build Littlefoot after noticing several bloggers loading jQuery exclusively for Bigfoot. See, this is how cool [Bigfoot.js](https://github.com/lemonmade/bigfoot) is, we load an entire library just to have quirky footnotes.

## Support

I made Littlefoot considering iOS devices mostly and I'm pretty certain it doesn't support IE9 (`classList`, uh?). It is still kinda clunky on iOS because apparently it bloody hates Javascript events.

## Credits

All of it to the team behind Bigfoot, I use a large chunk of their code in Littlefoot.
